# 🛑 CRITICAL: REPOSITORY BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE 🛑

As an AI agent operating in this repository, you MUST execute the following state check before analyzing, coding, or responding to any user prompt:

1. **CHECK STATE:** Silently verify if the file [`STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md`](./STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md) exists in the root directory.
2. **IF MISSING (UNINITIALIZED):**
   - Intercept the prompt: Acknowledge to the user that you are running the initial repository setup first.
   - Never (!) proceed without this file being present!
   - Read the file [`SETUP.md`](./.ai/SETUP.md) in the`./.ai/` directory..
   - Execute ALL setup, scaffolding, and configuration instructions defined in `SETUP.md` and related files. Ask the user about clarification where necessary.
   - Create the `STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md` file in the root directory to mark initialization as complete, setting its content to "project" or "boilerplate" - depending on what the user's case is about.
   - Proceed to fulfill the user's original request.
3. **IF PRESENT (INITIALIZED):**
   - Directly proceed to fulfilling the user's prompt.
   - Mind the content of the `STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md` as it defines your general scope as described in the [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

# General information and guidelines for AI agents

## Analyze your high-level use case first

Check for an `STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md` file at the root level. Its content is a single keyword that selects your mode:

- **`boilerplate`** - You are maintaining the boilerplate code itself as a contributor (not building a new website with it). Follow [`BOILERPLATE_MODE.md`](./.ai/BOILERPLATE_MODE.md). Do not execute the other `.ai` guides as setup steps (`SETUP.md`, `CONFIG_GUIDE.md`, `TRIMMING_GUIDE.md`, `FAVICON_GUIDE.md`); they describe the end-user setup flow. You may still read and **update** them when your changes affect that flow - keeping them accurate is part of boilerplate maintenance.
- **`project`** - You are using the boilerplate to build a new project and website. Treat this codebase as an already-started project to adjust and extend to the user's specifications, not as a boilerplate. Open [`PLAN.md`](./.ai/PLAN.md) first to see what is still open. If no `PLAN.md` exists yet, the configuration has not been planned - run [`SETUP.md`](./.ai/SETUP.md) to create it. Ignore [`BOILERPLATE_MODE.md`](./.ai/BOILERPLATE_MODE.md).

## How the `.ai` guidance files relate

The `.ai/` folder drives onboarding. The files depend on each other in a fixed order - follow the links rather than guessing what to do next:

```text
AGENTS.md (this file)            ← always read first; selects the mode
└─ STARDRIVE_AGENT_MODE.md                 ← stores the chosen mode ("boilerplate" | "project")
   ├─ boilerplate → BOILERPLATE_MODE.md
   └─ project / no mode yet → SETUP.md
                                 └─ CONFIG_GUIDE.md   ← project setup, builds PLAN.md
                                    ├─ TRIMMING_GUIDE.md  (only for direct clones; self-deletes when done)
                                    └─ FAVICON_GUIDE.md   (invoked at the favicon step)
                                 → PLAN.md            ← living checklist for "project" mode
```

## This is an Astro project

Validate whether you are connected to the Astro Docs MCP server (https://mcp.docs.astro.build/mcp).
If not, connect to it, or ask the user to add the config, if you are not allowed to do it directly.
See https://docs.astro.build/de/guides/build-with-ai/#installation for guidance.

This project is either the Astro Stardrive boilerplate or based on it. If you are in "project" mode, you can find up-to-date information about the foundational boilerplate at its [official repo](https://github.com/Peltmonger/stardrive).

## Further tech stack

- Astro
- Vite
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- TailwindCSS
- ESLint
- Prettier
- SolidJS
- Cloudflare Workers with Wrangler (prepared - might have been already dropped when you process this information here)
- Additional things that got added after the initial setup of this project

## General guidelines

The following guidelines are specific to this setup and always need to be respected.
They extend any existing general Agent guidelines, profiles, or skills.

- The [`package.json`](./package.json) holds all information about available scripts and dependencies.
- Astro is a **frontend** framework (static + optional on-demand SSR). Never store secrets or backend logic here. Sensitive work belongs in a real backend service.
- Use svg files alwas as components and never via Astro's <Image> component. The latter one would break in some cases - especially with Cloudflare.
- Always mind accessibility (create proper aria-labels, use semantic tags, consider keyboard + mouse + touch navigation, consider contrast colors when working with text).
- Always try to use what is native to Astro and can be found in its documentation, before creating own logic.
- Astro comes with an [Island Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/), which means that you can also create dynamic components with React, Vue, or Svelte. However, they add a lot of complexity, so try to avoid it. Decision tree (use what fits first):
  1. Can the functionality by achieved with Astro defaults or existing HTML?
  2. Would it be <50 lines with VanillaJS?
  3. Can it be achieved with a solidJS component, sticking to its core (smaller footprint than React)?
  4. Ask the user whether React, Vue, or Svelte is prefered for more complex things.
- Before implementing:
  - State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
  - If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
  - If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
  - If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- Simplicity First. Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. When working on a new project, try to stay as close as possible to what the boilerplate ships with - this also applies to structure.
- Styling: follow the same conventions and patterns that you detect in the surrounding code. Run `npm run check` to check and lint everyting or pick a more specific linter.

## Deciding: component vs. inline in the page

Keep markup inline in the page by default. Extract a component into `./src/components/` only when at least one of these is true:

- **Reuse:** the same block is needed on more than one page (e.g. content shared between the default-locale route and its `[lang]` counterpart - extract it so both stay in sync from a single source).
- **Size/complexity:** the block is a large, self-contained design element with its own logic or state, and lifting it out makes the page readable.
- **Clear responsibility:** the block is a reusable design primitive (callout, step, accordion, tabbed code, …) that other pages will plausibly want.

Do not create a component for a one-off snippet, and do not over-split into tiny atoms - this repo intentionally keeps components coarse (see the structure notes in the `README.md`). Group related docs/feature components in a topical subfolder (e.g. `./src/components/docs/`).

When a component only styles slot-provided prose (links, inline code, lists), prefer a shared CSS file in `./src/styles/` (imported via the `@styles/...` alias in the component frontmatter) over repeating the same scoped `<style>` block in every component.

Note on scoped `<style>` + Tailwind: inside an Astro `<style>` block, the Tailwind `@reference` directive must use a **relative** path (e.g. `@reference "../../styles/tailwind.config.css";`), not the `@styles/...` alias. The alias only resolves in JS/TS `import` statements, not in the CSS `@reference` context.

## Deciding: `[lang]` vs. dedicated language subfolders

Both live under `./src/pages/`. Choose based on how the content differs per language:

- **Use `./src/pages/[lang]/`** when the page structure is identical across languages and only the text differs. Put the strings in the `./src/i18n/*.json` files and read them with `useTranslations`. This keeps a single template for all locales. Prefer this for most pages, including short "note"-style pages.
- **Use a dedicated language subfolder** (`./src/pages/de/`, `./src/pages/es/`, `./src/pages/fr/`, with the default locale living directly under `./src/pages/`) when a page carries large, text-heavy blocks or content that genuinely differs per language. Hard-code those big text blocks directly in each language's file instead of bloating the i18n JSON files. The docs pages (`./src/pages/*/docs/`) are the reference example.

Rule of thumb: a few translated labels → `[lang]` + i18n JSON. Long prose or per-language content → dedicated subfolder with hard-coded text. Even then, extract shared design elements into components (see above) so only the copy differs between languages.

> [!TIP]
> When hard-coding large code samples in a page's frontmatter that themselves contain a line that is literally `---` (e.g. YAML frontmatter examples in a template literal), build that fence from a constant (`const fence = "---"; ... \`${fence}\n...\n${fence}\``). A bare `---` line inside the script block is otherwise mistaken for the closing fence of the Astro component's own frontmatter and breaks parsing.
