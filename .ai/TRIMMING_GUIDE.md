# Trimming Guide - Instructions

You are an AI agent executing the trimming of a freshly cloned Stardrive boilerplate. Your task is to bring this repository to a clean starting point for the user's own project by removing demo content and features they do not need.

This applies when the user cloned Stardrive **directly** (e.g. via `git clone`) instead of using the [`create-stardrive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-stardrive) scaffolding tool. `create-stardrive` performs these removals automatically; here you do them manually.

## How to execute

1. **Always-on steps** (marked `always`): execute them without asking. They remove demo/system files that are never useful in a real project and can cause conflicts.
2. **Optional steps** (marked `optional`): you MUST ask the user whether they want to keep that feature before removing anything related to it. Never delete an optional feature without explicit confirmation.
3. **Start by interviewing the user.** Present the optional features in one prompt - Blog, FAQ, Integration catalog, and Cloudflare hosting - and ask which they want to **keep**. Then remove only the ones they do not want.
4. When deleting a file or directory, verify it exists first. If it is already gone, report it and continue rather than failing.
5. After removals, complete the navigation cleanup and any dependency uninstall that corresponds to what was removed.
6. Do not commit changes unless the user asks.

### Context you can share with the user

Stardrive ships as a fully-populated demo site - the same codebase that powers [astro-stardrive.com](https://astro-stardrive.com/). Much of what is included is **example content showcasing the boilerplate's capabilities**, not production content. Demo content is easy to remove, but some features (like the blog) are interwoven and require code edits in addition to file deletions.

---

## Step 1 - System files (always)

Delete the following without asking:

- `./scripts/syncVersion.js`
- `./SECURITY.md`
- `./.github` (whole directory)

## Step 2 - Blog feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the blog (built on Astro's content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/utils/blog.ts`
- `./src/utils/reading-time.ts`
- `./src/styles/blog.css`
- `./src/pages/rss.xml.js`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/rss.xml.js`
- `./src/pages/blog`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/blog`
- `./src/layouts/article.astro`
- `./src/images/content/articles-fallback.jpg`
- `./src/images/content/articles`
- `./src/content/articles`
- `./src/components/structured/article.astro`
- `./src/components/blog`
- `./scripts/processSocialImages.js`
- `./public/data/articles`

Then edit:

- `./scripts/postbuild.js` - remove the line `await import('./processSocialImages.js');`
- `./src/content.config.ts` - remove the `const articles` declaration and remove `"articles"` from the export statement at the bottom.
- `./theme.config.ts` - remove the `articles` section, and remove `addArticles` from the `llms` settings.

## Step 3 - FAQ feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the FAQ (also uses content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/content/faq-answers`
- `./src/pages/faq.astro`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/faq.astro`

Then edit `./src/content.config.ts`:

- remove the `const faq_answers` declaration
- remove `"faq_answers"` from the export statement at the bottom

Then edit `./theme.config.ts`:

- remove `addFAQ` from the `llms` settings.

## Step 4 - Integration catalog feature (optional)

Ask the user whether they want to keep the integration catalog (also uses content collections). If they do **not** want it, remove:

- `./src/images/content/integration`
- `./src/content/integration-options`
- `./src/pages/integration`
- `./src/pages/[lang]/integration`
- `./src/components/integration-list.astro`

Then edit `./src/content.config.ts`:

- remove the `const integration_options` declaration
- remove `"integration_options"` from the export statement at the bottom

## Step 5 - Navigation cleanup (always, if anything was removed)

Edit `./src/components/layout/nav/footer-nav.astro` and remove navigation entries that point to features which were deleted. Inspect the file and remove only the links for features that no longer exist.

## Step 6 - Cloudflare specifics (optional)

Ask the user whether they will host on Cloudflare Workers (the boilerplate is preconfigured for it). If they will **not** use Cloudflare, remove:

- `./scripts/purgeCloudflareCache.js`
- `./worker-configuration.d.ts`
- `./wrangler.jsonc`
- `./public/_headers`

Then edit `./astro.config.ts` and remove:

- `import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';`
- the `adapter: cloudflare({ imageService: 'cloudflare' }), //(...)` line

Edit `./package.json` and remove the `purge:cloudflare` script.

Finally, uninstall the dependencies:

```bash
npm un @astrojs/cloudflare wrangler
```

## Step 7 - Verify, then delete this guide (always)

1. After all edits, verify the project still builds/type-checks cleanly (e.g. run the dev server or build) and fix any references left dangling by the removals.
2. **Delete this `TRIMMING_GUIDE.md` file.** It is only relevant for initial setup and must not ship with the user's website.
